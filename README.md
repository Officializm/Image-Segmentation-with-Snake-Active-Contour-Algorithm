# Image Segmentation with Snake (Active Contour) Algorithm

In this project, segmentation was performed with a method other than the threshold method. The method used is the snake method, also known as Active Contour. The application has been developed on MATLAB R2008b.
The application was tested on medical images and its performance was found to be more successful in detecting oval objects.
